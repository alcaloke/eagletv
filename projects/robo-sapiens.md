Robots with emotions; robots that converse with you; robots that play football; robots in your home.

Robots are going to change our world one day. But right now their designers are still working hard to stop them falling over.

Filmed at leading research centres in Japan and the USA this documentary puts the smartest, weirdest, sexiest and most athletic robots through their paces.

Robo Sapiens has been broadcast worldwide on Discovery Channel and on TLC in the USA.
