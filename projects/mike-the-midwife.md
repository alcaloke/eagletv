Meet Mike the Midwife, a man in a women’s world. How did such a fellow manage to get such a job? This is the question you will be asking as Mike visits his patients and offers opinions about childbirth that will horrify the politically correct.

The outrageous brainchild of writer Brian Thompson and part-time standup
comedian TC Jefferson, Mike the Midwife made his first public
appearance on YouTube in a series of brief no-budget video clips shot
during time off from their day jobs.

Many viewers of the YouTube postings took them at face value and
assumed they were documentaries. Some were outraged:
“There is no way you should comment on the state of someone’s pubic hair if you are a midwife,” one American pundit protested. “This guy is so unprofessional.”

Sensing a rich vein of comic potential, in 2011 we persuaded Channel 4’s head comedy to commission this short film to introduce Mike to the wider audience he deserved. It was to be the first of a series - but it fell foul of a new incoming head of programmes at C4 who just failed to see the joke.
